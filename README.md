# flyingcircus

From Wikipedia: "Barnstorming was a form of entertainment in which stunt pilots performed tricks, either individually or in groups called flying circuses". Flying Circus is also the last name of the Monty Python group, which makes this rather silly.

The purpose of this repository is to make something completely different from the "climate-statistics" one, being a place for tricks and pythonesque experiments of all kinds I might decide to do in a absolute informal tone.

I'm not so sure how "informal" informal is but, you know, anything can happen. Let us wait and see.
